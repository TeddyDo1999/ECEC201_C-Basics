ECEC201: Advanced Programming for Engineers

This is my repository to store codes submitted for labs in a course, ECEC201, taught by Dr Andrew Cohen in Fall Term 2019 at Drexel Univerisity. This course introduces the basics for C programming, good skills and habits for easy to comprehend code, and some tools for convenient programming: 
1. Virtual Machine (for students to get used to Linux cli)
2. VSCode IDE
3. Git

The Lab themes for each week are:
 - Week 1: HelloWorld.c, setting up the Virtual Machine and the environment in general
 - Week 2: some one-line commands in Bash. How to use debugging mode in VSCode
 - Week 3: Write program to generate random numbers based on input (genRand.c). Command line I/O, library importing, file handling, printing format (demonstarted in the pp.c files)
 - Week 4: Exercising with math and loops in C
 - Week 5: text file parsing, struct (binTree.c), and overflow (bufferAttack)
 - Week 6: (mid term): String operation (reverse a string in p0.c), multi-dimension array (sine.c)
 - Week 7: Modularity done with function in binTree.c (from week 5), recursion with Fibonacci number calculator
